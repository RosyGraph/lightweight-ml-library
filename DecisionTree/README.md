# Decision Tree

To download all dependencies and run the experiments from a Python virtual environment, `cd` into the `DecisionTree` directory and run the shell script `run.sh`. This will run each experiment from the homework. The total running time could take over an hour depending on your hardware.

```sh
./run.sh
```
