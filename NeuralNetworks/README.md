# Neural Networks

Usage:

```sh
./run.sh --help

Runner for neural network experiments

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

programming practice experiments:
  --q2a       compute the gradient with respect to all edge weights given the first training example
  --q2b       run stochastic gradient descent on bank data and report training and test error for various layer
              widths with weights initialized to random values from the standard normal distribution
  --q2c       run stochastic gradient descent on bank data and report training and test error for various layer
              widths with weights initialized to zeros
  --all       run all of the above experiments (this may take awhile
```
